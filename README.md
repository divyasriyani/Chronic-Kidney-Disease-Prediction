# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
Machine learning model to predict chronic kidney disease using patient medical data.  A data science project that analyzes health parameters to predict the likelihood of CKD. Chronic Kidney Disease prediction system using Python, scikit-learn, and machine learning algorithms.
# Chronic Kidney Disease Detection

This project predicts the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using **machine learning algorithms**.  
It analyzes patient medical data (blood pressure, blood glucose, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, etc.) to identify early signs of CKD and assist healthcare professionals in decision-making.


## üìå Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training with multiple ML algorithms  
- Performance evaluation and comparison  
- Prediction of CKD risk with high accuracy  


## üìÇ Dataset
- **Name**: `chronic_kidney_disease.csv`  
- **Size**: ~400 patient records  
- **Attributes**: 24 medical features including age, blood pressure, blood glucose, hemoglobin, albumin, packed cell volume, etc.  
- **Target Variable**: Presence or absence of CKD (`yes` / `no`)  

*(Dataset source: UCI Machine Learning Repository or institutional dataset used in project)*
